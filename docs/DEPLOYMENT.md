# Backend deployment configuration

## Render service

Create a Node web service with the repository root as its root directory:

- Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Runtime: Node 24 (also pinned by `.node-version`)
- Liveness check path: `/api/health`
- Readiness check path: `/api/ready`

The API listens on `0.0.0.0` and uses Render's `PORT` variable, falling back to `API_PORT` for local development. The frontend should be deployed separately as a static site. Set its `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the HTTPS URL of this API.

## API environment

Required on the API service:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV=production` | Enables production origin and TLS validation. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL URL for a dedicated login that inherits `balancevault_runtime`; never use an owner, migration, or superuser login. Production requires `sslmode=require`, `verify-ca`, or `verify-full`. |
| `AUTH_DATABASE_URL` | Separate read-only login inheriting only `balancevault_auth_runtime`. It is used only for credential verification and can read the bcrypt hash column. |
| `BALANCEVAULT_ACTOR_ASSERTION_KEY` | At least 32 random bytes encoded as hex. Configure the same secret in the API secret manager and the protected PostgreSQL verifier row. Never log or commit it. |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | At least 32 bytes; generate a random value, for example `openssl rand -base64 48`, and store it in Render's secret environment. |
| `WEB_ORIGIN` | Comma-separated exact HTTPS browser origins allowed by CORS. |
| `PORT` | Supplied by Render. |
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` | Optional per-instance pool cap; defaults to 10. Set based on database connection limits and the maximum number of service instances. |
| `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional connection timeout; defaults to 5000. |
| `DATABASE_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional readiness query timeout; defaults to 1500 ms. |
| `REDIS_URL` | Required Redis-compatible URL for shared auth limits (`redis://` or `rediss://`). Use a private Redis/Valkey service with TLS and ACL credentials where supported. |

`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` belongs only in a protected deployment/migration job, never on the running API service. Run `npm run db:migrate` as a separate release step using the migration login. The migration login must own the target database, be `NOINHERIT`, and have explicit membership with `SET` capability for the relevant `NOLOGIN` function-owner roles. Provision the database roles before migration with an administrator applying `apps/api/prisma/roles.sql`.

The API uses separate database identities: `DATABASE_URL` inherits only `balancevault_runtime`; `AUTH_DATABASE_URL` inherits only the read-only `balancevault_auth_runtime`. Runtime has column-scoped User reads and cannot select `passwordHash`. The authentication connection can read only the fields required to verify credentials. Provision its login separately; do not reuse the API runtime login.

Invitation creation/revocation and password changes require a short-lived, single-use HMAC assertion signed by the API after JWT verification. PostgreSQL verifies it against a secret in the non-public `balancevault_auth_private` schema. After migrations, provision the same secret to PostgreSQL and the API using `npm run admin:provision-actor-key -w apps/api` in a protected environment with `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` and `BALANCEVAULT_ACTOR_ASSERTION_KEY` configured. The script refuses to replace an existing key; rotation requires a coordinated maintenance procedure.

`BALANCEVAULT_BOOTSTRAP_DATABASE_URL` belongs only in the one-time operator bootstrap environment. Its login must be granted membership in `balancevault_bootstrap_operator` out of band. Never configure this variable on the API service or reuse the runtime login. Run `npm run admin:bootstrap -w apps/api` once after migrations. The SQL function is single-use and the runtime role cannot execute it. Later ADMIN/AUDITOR roles are provisioned through expiring, revocable invitations in the ADMIN user-management UI. Email delivery is not integrated; an administrator must deliver the one-time invitation link securely.

For a same-region Render Postgres internal URL, add `sslmode=require&uselibpqcompat=true` to require encrypted transport while permitting Render's self-signed internal certificate. For an external Render URL, use Render's provided hostname and TLS URL; do not replace it with a resolved IP. Render documents that internal TLS uses self-signed certs while external connections use Render-managed certificates. The compatibility parameter also avoids node-postgres's current warning that `sslmode=require` maps to certificate verification in its default mode.

The migration owner should not be a superuser. The runtime login should be a member only of `balancevault_runtime`, with no membership in the migration, posting, authentication, or account function-owner roles. API startup checks this membership boundary and fails closed if it is violated.

The privileged-provisioning, security-hardening, and final constant-time assertion migrations explicitly use `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`; Prisma Migrate does not implicitly wrap PostgreSQL migration SQL in a transaction. Do not remove those boundaries. They make function creation, ownership transfer, and ACL changes atomic. The security-hardening migration also changes default function privileges for the migration owner so new functions do not receive `PUBLIC EXECUTE`.

Three earlier forward migrations—`20261107220000_qualify_account_opening_user_query`, `20261107230000_qualify_approval_actor_query`, and `20261108001000_audit_account_holder_registration`—do not contain explicit transaction boundaries. Their statements are transaction-capable, but those migration files have already been applied to disposable PostgreSQL databases and must not be rewritten. Treat partial failure as a migration-recovery event: preserve the database, inspect `prisma migrate status` and the exact partial objects as the migration owner, repair through a reviewed forward migration or documented migration resolution, and rehearse the same procedure on a fresh disposable database before production. Do not mark a partially applied migration successful without verifying every intended owner, grant, revoke, and function definition.

## Static frontend security headers

The API adds JSON-appropriate CSP, frame, content-type, referrer, permissions, and request-correlation headers. In production the API emits HSTS only when the request is HTTPS (including a correctly trusted TLS-terminating proxy). Configure equivalent headers at the static frontend host; API response headers do not protect the HTML application. For the current Vite build, use a policy equivalent to `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://<api-origin>; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests`. Replace `<api-origin>` with the exact deployed API origin, validate the built application in a browser, and keep HSTS enabled only on HTTPS hosts.

## Operational limitations

- `/api/health` is liveness only. `/api/ready` checks both PostgreSQL pools and pings Redis within one bounded timeout. It returns a generic 503 if any check fails.
- Login and registration rate limits use a shared Redis store across API instances. Startup fails if Redis cannot connect. Requests fail closed with a generic 503 if the store becomes unavailable. Configure Redis with sufficient availability because login and registration will be unavailable during a Redis outage.
- For local development, install and start Redis, then use `REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0`. Auth endpoints intentionally do not fall back to per-process memory when Redis is unavailable.
- Pool limits apply per process. Multiply `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` by the maximum instance count and reserve connections for migrations and operations.
- The API logs only generic server-error events and error class names. Do not enable driver/SQL debug logging or log connection URLs in production.
- API responses carry a generated `X-Request-Id`; server error logs include that ID and the error class, but not request bodies or database details. Include the ID in support workflows without logging bearer tokens or passwords.
- The Render blueprint configures the API service and its readiness path. Provision database roles and run migrations separately with the migration identity.
- The browser currently stores short-lived bearer tokens in `sessionStorage`; same-origin script injection could steal them. Production should not proceed until an end-to-end server-managed `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite` session design with CSRF protection and tested session revocation is implemented, or the deployment owner explicitly accepts that documented risk after independent review.
- Recovery point objective (RPO), recovery time objective (RTO), and backup retention are not set in this repository. The service owner must define and approve them against business requirements before launch; no recovery target is claimed here.
- The read-only reconciliation command requires `RECONCILIATION_DATABASE_URL`, a non-superuser login inheriting only `balancevault_runtime`: `npm run ledger:reconcile -w apps/api`. It reports account ID, stored balance, ledger total, and difference; exit status 2 means discrepancies were found and requires investigation. It never updates data. Schedule and alert on it through the operations platform; scheduling is not implemented here.

## Datadog monitoring

Deploy the frontend on Vercel and the API on Render using the demo deployment guide. Keep ledger and audit records in PostgreSQL. Datadog receives operational telemetry.

In Datadog Synthetics, create HTTP checks for the public API's `/api/health` and `/api/ready` endpoints. Assert HTTP 200 and the expected JSON status (`healthy` and `ready`, respectively). Add a check for the public Vercel login page to cover frontend availability. Run the checks against a demo deployment using synthetic data and configure notifications for repeated failures. If the Render service sleeps, account for cold starts when choosing check timeouts and alert thresholds.

Use sanitized server logs and the response's `X-Request-Id` to investigate errors. Keep request bodies, bearer tokens, database URLs, customer details, and ledger data out of telemetry.

## Release checklist

- [ ] Pin the supported Node 24 runtime and install from the committed lockfile with `npm ci`.
- [ ] Validate Prisma, generate the client, run API and frontend suites on disposable infrastructure, run the dependency audit, and build the production frontend.
- [ ] Provision the database roles using a reviewed copy of `apps/api/prisma/roles.sql`; confirm the migration login owns the database and `public` schema.
- [ ] Take an encrypted PostgreSQL custom-format backup and verify it can be listed and restored into an isolated recovery database.
- [ ] Run `npm run db:migrate` in the protected release job with `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`; then verify `prisma migrate status` and critical function ownership/ACLs.
- [ ] Provision the actor assertion key using the protected CLI after migration; configure the matching API key through the secret manager.
- [ ] Bootstrap the first administrator with the separate operator identity. Remove the bootstrap credential from the operator environment afterward.
- [ ] Configure runtime-only API secrets, Redis TLS/ACL, exact HTTPS `WEB_ORIGIN`, PostgreSQL TLS, pool limits, and the frontend API URL.
- [ ] Deploy API and frontend over HTTPS. Verify `/api/health`, `/api/ready`, login, account-scoped reads, a controlled ledger operation, and audit events.
- [ ] Confirm logs contain no tokens, hashes, connection strings, or database error details. Confirm alerts cover API, PostgreSQL, Redis, backups, and failed financial operations.
- [ ] Approve measurable RPO, RTO, backup retention, and a recurring read-only ledger reconciliation schedule with discrepancy alerting.
- [ ] Implement and verify the production browser session architecture; configure and test CSP/HSTS headers on the static frontend host.

Do not treat a successful application build as a completed deployment. The first live rollout still requires operator review of the target environment and a separate authorization to modify that environment.

## Backup and restoration

Use the provider's consistent PostgreSQL backup mechanism when available. A manual custom-format backup can be made with `pg_dump --format=custom --file=balancevault-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S).dump "$DATABASE_URL"`. Store it encrypted and separately from the production database. Record the migration version alongside the backup and verify the dump with `pg_restore --list backup.dump`.

Restore to a new, isolated recovery database, not over the running production database: `pg_restore --no-owner --dbname="$RECOVERY_DATABASE_URL" backup.dump`. Provision roles and ownership, run application-level consistency checks, and verify migration state before traffic cutover. A schema migration is not automatically reversible; choose a restore point and cutover procedure through the incident plan. Preserve the affected database and logs for investigation.

After restore, run the read-only ledger reconciliation command and investigate every reported mismatch before traffic is routed. It does not modify balances or journal rows. Define backup retention and verify a restore on a recurring schedule selected to meet the approved RPO/RTO; this repository does not perform or attest to those operational exercises.
